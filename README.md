ResumeForge AI is an intelligent, full-stack agentic workflow designed to optimize resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) compatibility using hybrid scoring and semantic reasoning.

It doesn’t just rewrite resumes — it structures them, scores them, identifies skill gaps, and iteratively improves alignment using semantic intelligence powered by LLMs.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Resume Structuring
Transforms unstructured resumes (PDF/TXT) into structured, validated JSON:
- Professional Summary  
- Experience  
- Skills  
- Projects  
- Certifications  

Strict no-hallucination enforcement ensures accuracy and reliability.

### 🎯 Hybrid ATS Scoring Engine

Multi-dimensional scoring framework:

- 🔑 **Keyword Match Score** – High-impact skill overlap  
- 📈 **Quantification Score** – Measurable achievements detection  
- 🧠 **Semantic Relevance Score** – Context-aware LLM alignment  
- ⚠️ **Missing Skills Analysis** – Gap detection vs Job Description  

```text
Overall ATS Score =
(Keyword × 0.4) +
(Quantification × 0.2) +
(Semantic × 0.4)
```

This ensures resumes are optimized both syntactically and semantically.

### 🔄 Agentic Optimization Workflow (LangGraph)

ResumeForge AI models resume enhancement as a deterministic state machine:

1️⃣ Generate Structured Resume  
2️⃣ Compute ATS Score  
3️⃣ Detect Missing High-Impact Skills  
4️⃣ Generate Strategic Gap Questions  
5️⃣ Apply Improvements  
6️⃣ Re-score & Compare  

This creates a continuous feedback-driven optimization loop.
